GreenCompute is dedicated to addressing the critical environmental challenge of carbon emissions in data centers. Data centers, essential to our digital infrastructure, consume massive amounts of electricity to power servers and cooling systems. These facilities contribute to carbon emissions that are classified into three categories:

- **Scope 1** : Direct emissions from on-site fuel combustion, such as backup generators.
- **Scope 2** : Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, often the largest contributor for data centers.
- **Scope 3** : Indirect emissions from the entire supply chain, including embodied carbon in hardware manufacturing and emissions from logistics.

Our platform provides a comprehensive solution to measure these emissions, empowering data center operators and customers with actionable insights. We do this via two AI powered features: carbon emissions estimates and energy efficiency recommendations. Click on the links below to try them out!

            #### Carbon Emission Estimates
            Leveraging our trained ML models, we estimate annual carbon emissions by aggregating predictions for IT electricity consumption, embodied carbon, and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). Inputs such as memory, CPUs, location, and other factors are used to refine these predictions.
